### Description
This script was created as part of a training program at the GoIT school.

The program takes as input a list of dictionaries, each dictionary in it necessarily has the keys name and birthday. `name` is a string with the name of the user, and `birthday` is a datetime object in which the birthday of your friends, colleagues or partners is recorded.

The program outputs to the console the day of the week and the name of the people to congratulate on that day.
